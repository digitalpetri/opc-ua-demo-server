# Test Documentation & Quality Guidelines

## Every test must justify its existence

A test earns its place by verifying a **behavior that matters** — something that could break in a
way that affects users, correctness, or OPC UA (IEC 62541) spec compliance. If you can't articulate
what would go wrong if the test were deleted, the test probably shouldn't exist.

## Name the WHAT, comment the WHY

Write test method names as camelCase sentences that describe the behavior being tested. Use a
Javadoc or `//` comment above the test to explain *why* it matters — what invariant is being
protected, what bug it prevents, or what contract it enforces. When the behavior comes from the OPC
UA specification, cite the part and clause (e.g., "Part 3 §6.3.3.2") so a future reader can check
the test against the source of truth.

```java
// Part 6 requires the decoder to consume the entire chunk body;
// leftover bytes indicate a framing or length field error.
@Test
void binaryDecoderConsumesEntireChunkWithNoLeftoverBytes() {
    ...
}
```

```java
// Callers should not have to detect and retry after a channel drop —
// the session must be transparently re-established by the SDK.
@Test
void clientReEstablishesSessionAfterChannelDrop() {
    ...
}
```

```java
/**
 * Part 4 §5.10.2: a Read on an unknown NodeId must return Bad_NodeIdUnknown
 * in the per-item results, not fail the whole service call.
 */
@Test
void readUnknownNodeIdReturnsBadNodeIdUnknownPerItem() {
    ...
}
```

Single-line comments are fine. The goal is a sentence that a future reader (or LLM) can use to
decide whether this test is still relevant.

### Tests that don't need comments

If the WHY is obvious from the test name alone, skip the comment. A test named
`invalidEndpointUrlThrowsIllegalArgumentException` doesn't need a comment explaining that invalid
input should be rejected. Use judgment — but when in doubt, add the comment.

## What makes a good test

**Good tests challenge the code.** They verify:

- **Behavioral contracts** — "connect then disconnect leaves the client in the Disconnected state"
- **Edge cases with real consequences** — "an unknown type ID in an ExtensionObject must decode to
  the raw body, not throw or silently corrupt"
- **Protocol invariants** — "encoded structures round-trip back to an equivalent object with no
  leftover bytes"
- **Spec-mandated semantics** — "a Mandatory instance declaration on a supertype is inherited by
  instances of the subtype (Part 3 §6.3.3.2)"
- **Concurrency / timing** — "a request sent while reconnecting is queued and delivered once the
  channel is re-established"
- **Error recovery** — "after a session timeout, the next service call recreates the session and
  transfers subscriptions"

## What makes a weak test

**Weak tests exercise code paths without testing decisions.** Watch for:

- **Getter/property echo tests** — constructing an object and asserting each field equals what you
  passed in. This tests the language, not your code. Only justified if construction has validation
  logic or computed defaults worth protecting.
- **Exhaustive enum round-trips** — if `roundTrip(StatusCode.GOOD)` and
  `roundTrip(StatusCode.BAD_INTERNAL_ERROR)` exercise the same codec path, one is sufficient. Use
  parameterized golden-value tests when enum entries represent externally specified wire codes.
- **Exception constructor tests** — testing that a `UaException` can be instantiated adds zero
  value.
- **Implementation constant echo tests** — asserting a private implementation constant equals the
  value it was initialized with adds little value. Do write spec/golden-value tests for externally
  defined wire values, well-known NodeIds, status codes, and binary layouts.
- **"Walk the path" tests** — tests that call a method and assert it doesn't throw, without
  checking the result means anything.

## The LLM test smell

When reviewing LLM-generated tests, ask:

1. **Would deleting this test make me nervous?** If no, it's coverage theater.
2. **Does this test fail for an interesting reason?** A good test fails when behavior changes in a
   way that matters. A weak test fails when you rename a field.
3. **Is this testing my code or the language/framework?** Don't test that Java records or Netty
   buffers work.

## Test structure

- **One observable behavior per test.** If a test fails, the name should tell you what broke.
- **Avoid hidden branching.** Prefer `@ParameterizedTest` with `@MethodSource`, `@ValueSource`, or
  `@CsvSource` for table-driven cases with clear assertion messages. Keep control flow out of the
  main test body unless it makes fixture setup or protocol cases clearer.
- **Arrange / Act / Assert.** Set up state, perform the action or sequence under test, verify the
  result.
- **Use fixture/helper classes for test data.** Don't repeat builder or constructor calls with
  slightly different arguments; extract a shared fixture or factory method.
- **Control assertions.** When a test proves something *happens*, consider a companion assertion
  proving the same thing *doesn't* happen in the baseline case, with a message saying so — it
  guards against the test passing vacuously.

## Java / JUnit conventions

- Tests use JUnit Jupiter with statically imported `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` methods.
- Prefer `assertThrows(SomeException.class, () -> ...)` and assert on the caught exception when the
  message or status code matters.
- Prefer `assertEquals(expected, actual)` over `assertTrue(a.equals(b))` — it provides better
  failure messages. Mind the argument order: expected first.
- Add a failure message as the last argument when the assertion's purpose isn't obvious from the
  test name, e.g.
  `assertEquals(baseType.getNodeId(), decl.declaringTypeId(), "provenance: ...")`.
- Use `assertArrayEquals` for arrays and byte payloads; prefer readable hex or golden-byte helpers
  for protocol buffers.
- For async behavior, prefer completing `CompletableFuture`s with bounded
  `get(timeout, unit)`/`orTimeout` over `Thread.sleep`. Never assert on state that a background
  thread races to update without synchronization.

## Organizing tests

- Use `@Nested` inner classes to group tests by **feature or scenario**. Method-oriented groups are
  acceptable when the public API entry point is the behavior boundary, such as codecs or parsers.
- Name groups after the behavior area: `Lifecycle`, `Encode`, `Decode`, `Inheritance`,
  `ModellingRules`, `ErrorRecovery`. Split into separate test classes when a group grows large.
- `@DisplayName` is optional. A good method name usually makes it redundant.
- Use the `*Test` suffix for unit-test classes and `*IT` for integration-test classes. See
  [`running-tests.md`](running-tests.md) for the corresponding Maven invocations.
